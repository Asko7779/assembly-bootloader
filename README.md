## 🚀 Overview

**assembly-bootloader** is a 64-bit bootloader written in pure Assembly, serving as the entry point for my experimental operating system projects. This repository showcases low-level system programming and is ideal for those interested in understanding boot processes and x86_64 architecture.

---

## ✨ Features

- Pure x86_64 assembly code
- Minimal, educational, and efficient design
- Loads a 64-bit kernel and transfers control seamlessly
- Easily modifiable for your own operating system projects

## 🖥️ Project Structure

| File / Folder    | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `bootloader.asm` | Main bootloader source code                 |
| `Makefile`       | Build automation                            |
| `README.md`      | Project documentation                       |

## 🛠️ Customization

- Tweak `bootloader.asm` to change kernel loading behavior or add new features.
- Integrate your own kernel by modifying the build process as needed.
